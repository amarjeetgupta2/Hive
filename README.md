# Hive
**Hive is an open-source data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. 
It provides a high-level SQL-like language called HiveQL for querying and managing data stored in Hadoop.
Hive also provides a variety of other features, such as support for partitioning and bucketing, and the ability to run MapReduce jobs on HiveQL queries.**
